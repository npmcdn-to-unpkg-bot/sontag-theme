### **Triangles**

Today, I started a quest to design a mascot for my content style guide. Triangles, struck me like lightning again. So I revisited my Pinterest board of `Tri Angles`(also, spoke to Nivedita about Pinterest yesterday, she's been pinning recipes, #SouthIndia, #Thai and whatnot)

I needed more pins for my board. So I thought of visiting dribbble.
Searched `triangles dribbble` on Google and sifted through the triangles `tag` on dribbble. Dribbble houses the community that can elucidate design jargon, techniques and other words for my creeper to grow on.

Triangles attracted less interest. Most results were not what I was collecting. They weren't minimal. They din't conform to my levels.

* A - Abstract
* AA - Medium
* AAA - Minimal

This is where I encountered two designs of interest.
1. [Frida Kahlo Poster](https://dribbble.com/shots/2654148-Frida-Kahlo-Low-poly-Poster)
2. [A Background Texture Freebie](https://dribbble.com/shots/2685667-Free-Polygonal-Low-Poly-Background-Texture-74)

Both works had the word `low poly` in them. And they introduced me to the works of
1. [Susan Theresa Davis](https://dribbble.com/SoozayQ)
2. [Rounded Hexagon](https://dribbble.com/RoundedHexagon)

Luckily for me, Susan threw in her first design - called 'shots' - on Dribbble a little more than a month ago on 2nd April, 2016. She's got a Lennon shot and Frida Kahlo shot that are absolutely amazing. Learnt from the comment section there that this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9vpatthAgA) explains the technique using Illustrator and Photoshop. The video is 42 mins long.

Meanwhile, Rounded Hexagon is a Design Studio in Poland who experiment only with low poly designs. They have big presence over many social media platforms. They have an impressive gallery of textures on tumblr.

A search for `Triangle Design` opened up a Pandora's box of awesome-ness on Pinterest. So did a search for `Triangle Patterns`.
